# 🎯 Random Guess Number Game

Welcome to the **Random Guess Number Game**, a simple and fun Python-based terminal game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

## 🧠 How it Works

- The computer picks a random number between **1 and 100**.
- You keep guessing numbers until you get it right.
- After each guess, you'll get a hint:
  - `"Lower Number Please"` if your guess is too high.
  - `"Higher Number Please"` if your guess is too low.
- Once guessed correctly, the program congratulates you and shows the total number of attempts.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the `guess_number.py` file.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing the script.
4. Run the game using:
